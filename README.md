# Trees

The C++ codes for the trees are a combination of my solutions to the problems presented in Cracking the Coding Interview chapter which deals with Trees
and Graphs. The following code files are related to it:
- Check_Balanced.cpp
- Valid_BST.cpp
- Successor.cpp

The rest of the files are my additional solution implementation to the other operations related to Binary Trees.
