# Trees

The C++ codes for the trees are a combination of my solutions to the problems presented in Cracking the Coding Interview chapter which deals with Trees
and Graphs. The following code files are related to it:
- Check_Balanced.cpp
- Valid_BST.cpp
- Successor.cpp

The rest of the files are my additional solution implementation to the other operations related to Binary Trees.

Any suggestions or improvements to my solutions would be greatly appreciated. You can contact me at my LinkedIN profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitmurali8/
